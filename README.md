# Silver-Gift-Band-for-Survivors
This band is an amazing piece born from love for others. I created this band during the COVID-19 pandemic. As I noticed so many people suffering and the amazing dedication and resilience of our nation's hospital staff, I wanted to create a special for those whom I know personally. I originally created 10 bands which I passed out to nurses, doctors, techs, phlebotomists, a member of the cleaning staff, and other hospital workers.
Keep Commerce Human
Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. It’s home to a universe of special, extraordinary items, from unique handcrafted pieces to vintage treasures.
In a time of increasing automation, it’s our mission to keep human connection at the heart of commerce. That’s why we built a place where creativity lives and thrives because it’s powered by people. We help our community of sellers turn their ideas into successful businesses. Our platform connects them with millions of buyers looking for an alternative - something special with a human touch, for those moments in life that deserve imagination.
As a company, we strive to lead with our guiding principles and to help spread ideas of sustainability and responsibility whose impact can reach far beyond our own business.

Anti-Discrimination and Hate Speech Policy
Etsy connects thoughtful consumers around the world with creative entrepreneurs. It’s an ecosystem where people of all backgrounds inspire each other and build relationships through making, selling, and buying unique goods. We want everyone on Etsy to feel safe, and our priority is fostering an inclusive environment. This policy explains the kind of behaviour we prohibit on Etsy to make sure we all have a positive experience.

Community Policy
Community is at the heart of all we do at Etsy. Etsy sellers use community spaces to find inspiration, share knowledge, discuss ideas, and build relationships that help them grow their businesses.
